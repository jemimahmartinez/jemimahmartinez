### Hi there 👋 welcome to my GitHub!

My name is Jemimah Martinez :woman_student: and I am a Computer Systems Engineering student in my penultimate year at the University of Auckland 

I am interested in a Computer or Software Engineering job that will provide a way to broaden my knowledge on what I am currently learning. Furthermore, give me an understanding of how engineering impacts the world around us.
