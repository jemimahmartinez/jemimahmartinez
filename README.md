# Hi there 👋 welcome to my GitHub!

## My name is Jemimah Martinez :woman_student: and I am a Computer Systems Engineering student in my penultimate year at the University of Auckland 

### I am interested in a Computer or Software Engineering job that will provide a way to broaden my knowledge on what I am currently learning. Furthermore, give me an understanding of how engineering impacts the world around us. 

### ***“If I can do it, then I owe it to those who need it most.”***
